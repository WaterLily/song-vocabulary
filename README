This project compiles a set of words from Welsh folk songs and calculates the frequency with which they appear in the songs.  The purpose is to identify a good set of vocabulary words for a Welsh learner to study in order to understand Welsh folk music better.

First we parse the lyrics of a corpus of Welsh folk songs from http://www.meucymru.co.uk/music/Songs/Caneuon.html.  Then we map the words into root words using the lemmatizer API from the Welsh National Language Technologies Portal (see citation below).  Then we count how many times a form of each root word appears in each song.  The result is wesh_word_counts.csv, which can be used to derive document frequencies or overall frequencies or histograms or whatever else one is interested in.

Known imperfections: the source material contains a few songs in English, as well as possible typos.  We did minimal sanitization.
